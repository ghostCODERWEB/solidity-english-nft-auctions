# Architecture

## Domain

ERC721 English auctions with token bids, anti-sniping extensions, reserve prices and pull refunds.

## Trust and economic model

No auction fees or royalties. Bids escrow the full new amount and return old bids as credits. Recipient contracts must accept ERC721 safe transfer at settlement. Anti-sniping extension can prolong auctions indefinitely under continued bids.

## Components

`NFTAuctions` holds domain state and exposes transitions. `SuiteBase` provides two-step ownership, pause control and reentrancy protection to administrative suites. `AssetFlow` verifies exact incoming token balance changes and performs checked native payouts. OpenZeppelin supplies token standards, math, safe transfers, Merkle verification and NFT reception.

`test/contracts/TestAssets.sol` contains unrestricted mint helpers, a fee-burning token and a rejecting native receiver. These are excluded from the deployment guide's primary contract and must never be used as real assets.

## Units and timing

All amounts are base units. ERC20 decimals are not automatically normalized. Timestamps use block.timestamp in seconds; tests advance the local chain explicitly. Integer operations round down except where OpenZeppelin defines standard ERC4626 rounding. Externally supplied amounts must account for dust and slippage.

## Failure semantics

A failed precondition or external transfer reverts the whole transaction. Accounting and settlement flags revert with it. Events report completed transitions. Off-chain clients should verify successful receipts and retain relevant event IDs.

## Build reproducibility

Pinned npm dependencies, exact compiler version, optimizer settings and explicit Cancun EVM target. Compilation includes storage layouts and deployed-bytecode size validation against EIP-170. Generated build output is not committed.
